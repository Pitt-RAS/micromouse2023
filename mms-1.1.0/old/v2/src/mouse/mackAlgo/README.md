This directory contains the code that was used by the University at Buffalo at
the 2015 IEEE Region 1 Micromouse competition. It's an implementation of Dijkstra's 
shortest-path algorithm with a heuristic to choose the "fastest path" (more
straightaways) instead of simply the shortest path. It uses tile colors to indicate
it's frequently re-calculated fastest path, as well as the tiles already explored.
