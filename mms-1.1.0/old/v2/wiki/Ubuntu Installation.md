### Why Ubuntu

*mms* was developed on Ubuntu, and is the project's best supported platform.

### Installation

First, install the necessary software packages:
```bash
sudo apt-get install g++ freeglut3-dev libglew-dev
```

Then build the project (run this from the project root directory):
```bash
make
```

### Running *mms*

It's as simply as running the following (again, from the project root directory):
```bash
./bin/mms
```
